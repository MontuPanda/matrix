# matrix

A game where you can block, shoot and reload.

if block or shoot is chosen a potency/no. of bullets must be chosen from 1 to 4.

If any invalid input is typed the user loses.

The computer's choice is only decided using no. of bullets of both user and computer as well as the random module in Python.


By reloading your no. of bullets increases by 1.

Shooting takes away bullets if no one dies and game continues.

Blocking doesn't require bullets.

If you shoot more bullets than you have then you lose.

If both user and computer shoots whichever shoots more wins, if it's the same then game continues.

if shooting bullets is the same no. as the block by other then game continues, if its not the same then the one blocking loses.


Note: Storing bullets is NOT capped at 4 but USING them is capped at 4.
